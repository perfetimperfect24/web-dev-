		<h2>This Is My First Article</h2>
		<p class="quote">The year was 1845. Edgar Allan Poe’s famous poem The Raven first appears in the Evening Mirror. Two years earlier Poe had earned widespread acclaim for The Tell-Tale Heart, a short story in which an unnamed narrator forcefully, though paradoxically, defends his own sanity while confessing to the murder of an old man.</p>

		<P>Poe, who spun tales of tragedy, mystery and horror, had a knack for injecting trouble into his own life. It was in 1845 that Poe’s penchant for troublemaking would put him at odds with none other than fellow writer Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
		As a literary critic, Poe was not alone in his belief that Longfellow was a plagiarist. He was possibly the most outspoken about it. Poe used speaking engagements, his editing position at the Broadway Journal, and anonymous articles to accuse Longfellow of stealing from the likes of Tennyson, Milton, Shakespeare and Coleridge, among others.</P>

		<p>Poe used one review of Longfellow’s poems, to insinuate that Longfellow’s celebrity stemmed, not from talent, but from his position as a Harvard professor and his marriage to an heiress. Poe went on to note various poems as:
			<ul>
				<li>scarcely worth the page it occupies</li>
				<li>mere common place</li>
				<li>has nothing in it beyond common thoughts very gracefully expressed</li>
				<li>utterly worthless as a poem</li>
			</ul>

	<h2>That time I asked about someone’s novel</h2>
	<p>Most of us will never experience anything close to Poe’s public criticism of Longfellow.</p>

	<p>We’ll also never come to blows with other writers like the time poet Wallace Stevens got into a brawl with Ernest Hemingway, the Ernest Hemingway. The incident left Stevens with a broken hand and a black eye.</p>

	<p>Still, there are moments in this creative journey that will make us curious about the rules, spoken and unspoken, for how we treat each other as writers. For me that moment happened about a year ago.</p>

	<p>It started innocently enough. We were in an online community for creative entrepreneurs. A guy mentioned that he was working on a novel. I told him that was great. I asked what the book was about.
	His response, essentially, not verbatim:
	Nicole, I have no intentions of sharing any details about my work in progress. I find it presumptive that you would ask.
	My response, essentially, not verbatim:
	Okay. Cool.</p>
	<p>From time to time I think about that guy, a fellow writer, who found me presumptive. I wonder if he still posts that he is writing a novel, and then bristles at anyone who dares to ask about it.</p>
	<p>I wonder if at this very moment he is pounding out the last chapter. Or maybe he’s finished. And published. And successful.
	Mostly, I wonder if I violated an established code of behavior by asking a novelist what his novel was about.</p>
